 Scrimba Weekly Web Dev Challenge - Film Database

 This database uses React. I've created a FilmCard.js component so that there's a standard layout for each card and the film details can simply be mapped from the film array, where the details of each film are stored.

 The styling includes flex-wrap so that new cards can be added and will respond to the viewport size.
